(he/ him/ his)

I am a University of Utah graduate with years of experience writing in various professional capacities, currently working full-time remotely as a support engineer for Adobe Workfront. I live with my wife and our two dogs in Silverton, Colorado, a former mining town at 9,300' in the San Juan mountain range. In the past I've lived, worked and played on Oahu, in the Blue Ridge, along the Wasatch Front and Back, and in the Sierra Nevada.

Currently interested in and open to technical writing opportunities, I am a passionate creative with a breadth of professional experience and personal interests in software, stringed instrument music, farm-to-table food production, the outdoors industry, and journalistic writing. My core ethic is to better my life and the lives of those in my immediate communities through a hard-working, human-powered DIY approach.
