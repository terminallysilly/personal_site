(he/ him/ his)

I am a University of Utah graduate with years of experience writing in various professional capacities. For the last several years, I have worked full-time remotely as a B2B and B2C support engineer for several workforce management companies. I live with my wife and our two dogs in Silverton, Colorado, a former mining town located at 9,318' elevation in the San Juan mountain range. In the past I've lived, worked and played on Oahu, in the Blue Ridge, along the Wasatch Front and Back, and in the Sierra Nevada.

Currently interested in and open to customer support, account management, support engineering, leadership, and technical writing opportunities. I am a passionate creative with a breadth of professional experience and personal interests in software, stringed instrument music, farm-to-table food production, the outdoors industry, and journalistic writing. My core ethic is to better my life and the lives of those in my immediate communities through a hard-working, human-powered DIY approach.
